# End-to-End Student Performance Machine Learning Project with Azure Deployment

This repository contains an end-to-end Machine Learning project for predicting **student performance** with deployment on **Microsoft Azure**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training for student performance prediction.
- ML model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
- Deployment using **Azure Web App Service** for real-time predictions.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/StudentPerformance-ML-Azure.git
   cd StudentPerformance-ML-Azure
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application locally  
   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```

4. Deploy on Azure  
   - Create a Web App Service in Azure  
   - Connect GitHub repo for CI/CD  
   - Deploy and test API endpoint  

## 📊 Results
- The model predicts student performance metrics such as final grades, pass/fail, and overall academic risk.
